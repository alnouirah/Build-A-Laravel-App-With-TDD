# [Build-A-Laravel-App-With-TDD](https://laracasts.com/series/build-a-laravel-app-with-tdd)

> It's time to take the techniques we learned in Laravel From Scratch, and put them to good use building your first real-world application. Together, we'll leverage TDD to create Birdboard: a minimal Basecamp-like project management app.  This series will give us a wide range of opportunities to pull up our sleeves and test our Laravel chops. As always, we start from scratch: laravel new birdboard.

## 01.[Meet Birdboard](https://laracasts.com/series/build-a-laravel-app-with-tdd/episodes/1)

> Let's begin by reviewing the application that we plan to build. We'll then finish up by installing Laravel and performing the first commit.

## 02.[Let's Begin With a Test](https://laracasts.com/series/build-a-laravel-app-with-tdd/episodes/2)

> My hope is to demonstrate, as much as possible, my actual workflow when writing my own applications. With that in mind, let's begin with our first feature test.
