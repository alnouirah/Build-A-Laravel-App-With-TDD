# [Build-A-Laravel-App-With-TDD](https://laracasts.com/series/build-a-laravel-app-with-tdd)

> It's time to take the techniques we learned in Laravel From Scratch, and put them to good use building your first real-world application. Together, we'll leverage TDD to create Birdboard: a minimal Basecamp-like project management app.  This series will give us a wide range of opportunities to pull up our sleeves and test our Laravel chops. As always, we start from scratch: laravel new birdboard.

## 01. [Meet Birdboard](https://laracasts.com/series/build-a-laravel-app-with-tdd/episodes/1)

> Let's begin by reviewing the application that we plan to build. We'll then finish up by installing Laravel and performing the first commit.

## 02. [Let's Begin With a Test](https://laracasts.com/series/build-a-laravel-app-with-tdd/episodes/2)

> My hope is to demonstrate, as much as possible, my actual workflow when writing my own applications. With that in mind, let's begin with our first feature test.

### Note

> tests\Feature\ProjectsTest.php

```php
<?php

namespace Tests\Feature;

use Tests\TestCase;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\WithFaker;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Testing\RefreshDatabase;

class ProjectsTest extends TestCase
{
    use WithFaker, RefreshDatabase;

    /** @test */
    public function a_user_can_create_a_project()
    {   
        $this->withoutExceptionHandling();

        $attributes = [
            'title' => $this->faker->sentence,
            'description' => $this->faker->paragraph
        ];

        $this->post('/projects', $attributes)->assertRedirect('projects');

        $this->assertDatabaseHas('projects', $attributes);

        $this->get('/projects')->assertSee($attributes['title']);
    }
}
```

```bash
php artisan make:test ProjectsTest
vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Feature/ProjectsTest.php --filter '/::a_user_can_create_a_project$/'
vendor/bin/phpunit tests/Feature/ProjectsTest.php --filter a_user_can_create_a_project
```

> phpunit.xml

```xml
<php>
    <env name="DB_CONNECTION" value="sqlite"/>
    <env name="DB_DATABASE" value=":memory:"/>
</php>
```

## 03. [Testing Request Validation](https://laracasts.com/series/build-a-laravel-app-with-tdd/episodes/3)

> We haven't yet written any request validation logic. As before, let's use a TDD approach for specifying each validation requirement.

### Note

```bash
alias pf="vendor/bin/phpunit --filter"
pf a_project_requires_a_title
pf ProjectsTest
```

```bash
php artisan make:factory ProjectFactory --model="App\Project"
```

```php
factory('App\Project')->make();
factory('App\Project')->make(['title' => '']);
factory('App\Project')->raw(['title' => '']);
```

## 04. [Model Tests](https://laracasts.com/series/build-a-laravel-app-with-tdd/episodes/4)

> We must next ensure that a user can visit any project page. Though we should start with a feature test, this episode will provide a nice opportunity to pause and drop down a level to a model test.

### Note

```bash
php artisan make:test ProjectTest --unit
```

```php
factory('App\Project', 5)->create();
```

> resources\views\projects\index.blade.php

```php
@forelse ($projects as $project)
    <li><a href="{{ $project->path() }}">{{ $project->title }}</li>
@empty
    <li>No projects yet.</li>
@endforelse
```

## 05. [A Project Requires An Owner](https://laracasts.com/series/build-a-laravel-app-with-tdd/episodes/5)

> It's true that we can now create and persist projects to the database, but they aren't currently associated with any user. This isn't practical. To fix this, we'll write a test to confirm that the authenticated user is always assigned as the owner of any new project that is created during their session.

### Note

```bash
php artisan make:auth
```

> database\migrations\2019_02_26_100953_create_projects_table.php

```php
$table->foreign('owner_id')->references('id')->on('users')->onDelete('cascade');
```

> database\factories\ProjectFactory.php

```php
[
    'owner_id' => function () {
        return factory(App\User::class)->create()->id;
    }
]
```

> tests\Feature\ProjectsTest.php

```php
$this->actingAs(factory('App\User')->create());
```

> tests\Unit\UserTest.php

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection;

$this->assertInstanceOf(Collection::class, $user->projects);
```

## 06. [Scoping Projects](https://laracasts.com/series/build-a-laravel-app-with-tdd/episodes/6)

> In this episode, we'll continue tweaking which projects are displayed to the user. We'll also begin implementing the appropriate page authorization.

### Note

> tests\Feature\ProjectsTest.php

```php
$this->be(factory('App\User')->create());

$this->get($project->path())->assertStatus(403);
```

> routes\web.php

```php
Route::group(['middleware' => 'auth'], function () {
    Route::get('/projects', 'ProjectsController@index');
});
```

> app\Http\Controllers\ProjectsController.php

```php
if (auth()->user()->isNot($project->owner)) {
    abort(403);
}
```

## 07. [The Create Project View](https://laracasts.com/series/build-a-laravel-app-with-tdd/episodes/7)

> We already have the necessary logic to persist new projects, however, we haven't yet created the "create project" page, itself. Let's take care of that quickly in this episode.

## 08. [Prepping the Frontend](https://laracasts.com/series/build-a-laravel-app-with-tdd/episodes/8)

> Before I begin writing CSS, we first need to set the stage. We'll begin by pulling in all necessary npm dependencies and configuring Tailwind compilation with Laravel Mix.

### Note

#### Tailwind

```bash
# 1. Install Tailwind via npm
npm install tailwindcss --save-dev
# 2. Create a Tailwind config file
npx tailwind init
```

> webpack.mix.js

```js
require('laravel-mix-tailwind');

mix.js('resources/js/app.js', 'public/js')
   .sass('resources/sass/app.scss', 'public/css')
   .tailwind();
```

## 09. [Go Go Gadget Tailwind](https://laracasts.com/series/build-a-laravel-app-with-tdd/episodes/9)

> In this episode, we'll leverage [Tailwind](http://tailwindcss.com/) to begin constructing the Birdboard UI.

### Note

> resources\views\projects\index.blade.php

```html
<div>{{ Illuminate\Support\Str::limit($project->description) }}</div>

<div>{{ str_limit($project->description) }}</div>
```

## 10. [Grid Spacing and Card Tweaks](https://laracasts.com/series/build-a-laravel-app-with-tdd/episodes/10)

> Let's continue working on the CSS for the projects dashboard. This will give us an opportunity to discuss grid spacing, and how we can use a combination of padding and negative margins to perfectly align our columns.

### Note

> resources\sass\app.scss

```sass
.button {
    @apply bg-blue text-white no-underline rounded-lg text-sm py-2 px-5;
    box-shadow: 0 2px 7px 0 #b0eaff;
}
```

## 11. [Styling the Project Page](https://laracasts.com/series/build-a-laravel-app-with-tdd/episodes/11)

> Before we jump back to PHP, let's write one more lesson's worth of CSS. Specifically, we'll get the single project page up and running.

## 12. [A Project Can Have Tasks](https://laracasts.com/series/build-a-laravel-app-with-tdd/episodes/12)

> We've added a section to our project page for tasks, but that functionality doesn't yet exist. It sounds like we have our next step.

> View the source code for this episode [on GitHub](https://github.com/laracasts/birdboard/commit/0533ad74b757f8447b6351ad62a5cd4bed569d86).

### Note

```bash
php artisan make:model -m Task
```

> tests\TestCase.php

```php
public function signIn($user = null)
{
    $this->actingAs($user ?: factory('App\User')->create());
}
```

> tests\Unit\ProjectTest.php

```php
/** @test */
public function it_can_add_a_task()
{
    $project = factory('App\Project')->create();
    
    $task = $project->addTask('Test task');

    $this->assertCount(1, $project->tasks);
    $this->assertTrue($project->tasks->contains($task));
}
```

> tests\Feature\ProjectTasksTest.php

```php
$project = auth()->user()->projects()->create(
    factory(Project::class)->raw()
);
```

## 13. [Task UI Updates](https://laracasts.com/series/build-a-laravel-app-with-tdd/episodes/13)

> The next step is to update your project page UI to allow for displaying and adding new tasks.

### Note

> tests\Feature\ProjectTasksTest.php

```php
# two different name
/** @test */
public function only_the_owner_of_a_project_may_add_tasks()
public function adding_a_task_if_you_are_not_the_project_owner()

$this->assertDatabaseMissing('tasks', ['body' => 'Test task']);
```

## 14. [Task UI Updates: Part 2](https://laracasts.com/series/build-a-laravel-app-with-tdd/episodes/14)

> In this episode, we'll wrap every task within a form so that we may easily update its description or completion status with the click of a button.

> View the source code for this episode on [GitHub](https://github.com/laracasts/birdboard/commit/10c753148feec2430ecd2d2177c64d361cc3d343).

### Note

```bash
php artisan migrate:rollback
php artisan migrate
```

> resources\views\projects\show.blade.php

```php
<input type="checkbox" name="completed" onchange="this.form.submit()" {{ $task->completed ? 'checked' : '' }}>
```

> tests\Feature\ManageProjectsTest.php

```php
$response = $this->post('/projects', $attributes);
$response->assertRedirect(Project::where($attributes)->first()->path());
```

> database\factories\TaskFactory.php

```php
'project_id' => factory(\App\Project::class)
// 'project_id' => function () {
//     return factory(\App\Project::class)->create()->id;
// }
```

> database\migrations\2019_03_01_074823_create_tasks_table.php

```php
$table->timestamp('completed')->default(false);
$table->boolean('completed')->default(false);
```

## 15. [Touch It](https://laracasts.com/series/build-a-laravel-app-with-tdd/episodes/15)

> I'd like to sort all projects in our dashboard according to those that have been most recently updated. This means, when you add or modify a task within a project, we need to touch the parent project's `updated_at` timestamp in the process. Let's learn how in this episode.

> View the source code for this episode [on GitHub](https://github.com/laracasts/birdboard/commit/2192501f311626560eaf55362e55cde5542abb05).

### Note

> app\Task.php

```php
protected $touches = ['project'];

public function project()
{
    return $this->belongsTo(Project::class);
}
```

## 16. [Notes and Policies](https://laracasts.com/series/build-a-laravel-app-with-tdd/episodes/16)

> Next up, we need to make the "General Notes" section of the project page dynamic. As always, we'll use tests to drive this new update. When finished, we'll also switch over to using dedicated authorization policy classes.

> View the source code for this episode [on GitHub](https://github.com/laracasts/birdboard/commit/40afb9c6138578ee22623d3806d398d84fcf1a1b).

### Note

```bash
php artisan make:policy ProjectPolicy
```

> app\Policies\ProjectPolicy.php

```php
public function update(User $user, Project $project)
{
    return $user->is($project->owner);
}
```

> app\Providers\AuthServiceProvider.php

```php
protected $policies = [
    'App\Project' => 'App\Policies\ProjectPolicy',
];
```

> app\Http\Controllers\ProjectsController.php

```php
$this->authorize('update', $project);
```

> If you want to apply the fixes to the forms that Jeff has applied "behind the scenes", you'll find all the changes in [this commit](https://github.com/laracasts/birdboard/commit/0ac821b456e599a9c7a8ff3ec7327202c88c6516).

## 17. [Improve Test Arrangements With Factory Classes](https://laracasts.com/series/build-a-laravel-app-with-tdd/episodes/17)

> Let's take a moment to improve the structure of our tests. Have you noticed that, time and time again, we follow a similar pattern when arranging the world for a test? Instead, let's refactor this code into a fluent factory class to save time. To do this, we'll use a technique that I first learned from John Bonaccorsi in his [Tidy up Your Tests with Class-Based Model Factories](https://tighten.co/blog/tidy-up-your-tests-with-class-based-model-factories) article. I encourage you to give it a read if you'd like to learn more.

## 18. [Reduce Form Duplication](https://laracasts.com/series/build-a-laravel-app-with-tdd/episodes/18)

> In this lesson, we'll add a form to update an existing project. But in the process, we'll review how to reduce duplication in the `create` and `edit` views by extracting a reusable partial.

    </div>
@endif
```

## 19. [Sometimes Validation With Form Requests](https://laracasts.com/series/build-a-laravel-app-with-tdd/episodes/19)

> We'll begin this episode by addressing a small regression that was introduced in the previous episode: we can no longer update the general notes without triggering a validation error. While of course we'll review the easy solution to this issue, we'll additionally discuss a recent user comment related to the pros and cons of extracting a form request class. Would it make the code cleaner or better? You can look forward to lots of fun tips in this episode.

## 24. [Rendering Activity With Polymorphism](https://laracasts.com/series/build-a-laravel-app-with-tdd/episodes/24)

> It's time to render a project's activity feed on the page. This will give us an opportunity to review how to use polymorphism to load the appropriate view, based on the description type of the activity.

> View the source code for this episode [on GitHub](https://github.com/laracasts/birdboard/commit/c2bc7499a4cbca265ed393f456f0752c623dfb02).

## 25. [The Subject of the Activity](https://laracasts.com/series/build-a-laravel-app-with-tdd/episodes/25)

> Now that we're successfully displaying a project's activity feed on the page, I'd like to provide more information for each update. For example, rather than the message, "You completed a task", it should probably include the name of the task: 'You completed "Finish Lesson"'. This presents a problem because, when we record activity, we don't yet include any reference to the subject. Let's fix that in this episode.
